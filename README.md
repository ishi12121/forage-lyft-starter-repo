# Lyft Back-end Engineering Project
This repo is my completed project from the Lyft Back-End Engineering Virtual Experience Program on Forage. This practical, hands-on learning experience led by developers at Lyft included the following modules:

## Software Architecture
- **Task**: Draft a new architecture for a poorly designed component of the rental fleet's logistics system
- **Objectives**: Use object oriented programming (OOP) to design an easily extensible and modifiable system architecture
- **Topics**:
  - Composition over inheritance
  - Behavioral patterns
  - UML class diagramming
  
## Refactoring
- **Task**: Rewrite the codebase following a provided class diagram
- **Objectives**: Write lasting, clean code that accurately implements the desired system architecture
- **Topics**:
  - Factory method design pattern
  - Strategy design pattern
  - Refactoring

## Unit Testing
- **Task**: Add a series of unit tests for the concrete implementations of two classes
- **Objectives**: Create effective unit tests that capture edge cases
- **Topics**:
  - Python unittest
  - Unit testing
  - Clean coding

## Test-Driven Development
- **Task**: Add new functionality to the system and modify an existing component, ensuring all tests pass
- **Objectives**: Use test-driven development (TDD) to seamlessly integrate a new module into the system
- **Topics**:
  - Test-driven development
  - Agile development
  - Extending codebases
